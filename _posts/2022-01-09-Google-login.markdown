## Preface

Sometimes when we log out of our Google account when using Google Chrome, we can no longer log in again. This problem also troubles many people. I found a solution to this problem by looking for information, so I put it here for your reference.

When you log out of the Google account, try to log in again, the following interface may appear.

There are many ways to solve this problem on the Internet, but I tried and found that only this way works.

We find the installation path of chrome.

![photo2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/google-login/1.png){:width="60%"}

We first close all chrome processes, and then use this exe to open the browser to log in.
